2. Approach
My approach was simple. To make the PCFG I would load the cfg and then keep track of each occourence of LHS and RHS to get a probability. For the parser I would take my approach from HW3, add in probability and tune it based on my results. I was able to implement this quite quicky with very few changes and pretty much immediatley had 99.06% accuracy. To see how I could improve I looked at the 5 out of the 55 sentences I got wrong and noticed there was some issues around case(rule only being for lower case). My improvement is if my system doesnt generate a parse then it tries to parse with the sentence as lower case. This was able to fix one of the 5 I had originally gotten wrong!
3. Problems 
Still get 4 out 55 wrong.

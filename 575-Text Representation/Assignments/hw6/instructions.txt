Use the pertained word2vec model from Hw4
• Apply them to the SICK data and obtain the vectors for each sentence
• Train and test (on canvas)
• Use the average embedding of all words to present the sentence
• Train a logistic regression model on the vectors for NLI
• Compare with the skip-thought
• https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts
• Submit
• model.py (the model file, implemented by Keras)
• readme.txt (report the results, and your analysis)

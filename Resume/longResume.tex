\section{WORK EXPERIENCE} 
{\sl Program Manager 2}-Microsoft Bing, Applied Science \& Metrics  \hfill 11/2017-
\begin{itemize}  \itemsep -4pt 
\item Drove scaling and rearchitecture of offline metrics stack through new offline labeling tasks, novel query set sampling methods, and metric aggregation.  Improved labeling taskskrippendorff's alpha by 2-3x. Pipeline scaled to \$7m/year across 16 markets on a with a decrease in label and query latency from months to minutes.
\item Research and analyzed Bing Relevance performance for executive team across various verticals, languages, and metrics using langauge embeddings, scikit-learn, and NLTK.
\item  Built Family of MSMARCO Datasets and baselines including Question Ansering, Language Generation and Passage Ranking garnering which collectively have been used by over 1000 Deep Learning Researchers. Baselines models built primarily in Pytorch and Tensorflow.
\end{itemize}
{\sl Program Manager 2}-Microsoft Cloud + AI, Global Services C\&E \hfill 05/2016-11/2017
\begin{itemize}  \itemsep -4pt
\item Designed, built and deployed Neural Machine Translation into software localization pipeline for entire division. Using the improved pipeline, renegociated supplier contracts bringing $20\%$ savings anualizing to \$1m/year savings.
\item Optimized and expanded NLP system for customer feedback translation and categorization decreasing team effort by $80\%$ using NLTK, Tensorflow, and scikit-learn.
\item Drove end to end localization and internationalization for Azure and Visual Studio products including automation, bug triage, budgeting, vendor and release management.
\end{itemize}

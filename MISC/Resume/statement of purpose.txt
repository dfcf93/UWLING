In the next few years I will be focusing my efforts to research the relationships of complex systems using unlabeled data with a focus on data and learning efficiency. 
I believe that my undergraduate and graduate schooling, my past research projects, and my current job have uniquely prepared to take on this problem starting with a shallow focus in language systems and expanding beyond.
When I was pursuing my undergraduate degree my main goal was to ensure I built up a strong computer science base which I could build a specialization on. 
Initially I was so focused on finishing this that I didn't realize I would could graduate in 3 years until my advisor told me 2.5 years in. Caught off guard and deeply motivated after my first machine learning course(Fall 2013) I took the spring semester off to work on a Research team.
My time at Basis Technology(January-May 2014) was unlike anything I had experienced previously. I joined as a research intern where my focus was to explore multilingual Named Entity Resolution. In this role I great boss(Dr. James Clarke) who helped feed my voracious appetite to learn. Along with teaching me how to formulate ideas as testable hypohtesis, he exposed me to

Outside of studying I set to read and understand the basis of deep learned methods in NLP by reading all the papers and their citations. Moreover I connected with many of the researchers in my work and masters to explain my hopes and discuss wether a PhD is the right path. The
The desire to do a PhD comes from a confirmation that I want to focus on research and a gain a deep understanding of applied methods in natural language processing.
Based on my current experience I want to explore building large scale language representations but with a focus on data efficiency. Current approaches in NLP have proven to be very successful but are clearly not scalable, models take weeks to create, require a corpus of the whole internet and are difficult to recreate. 
I believe that there is much work to be done on understanding how small we can make datasets and still have the model learn robust representations of langauge. 
Spurred by my own origin of a bilingual background I would be keen to further expand models that work with all langues by default and can have a firm understanding of multilinguality.
